## Overview
The Akamai Firewall Rules Notification Kit is a set of go libraries that wraps Akamai's {OPEN} APIs to let you manage who receives notifications about changes Akamai makes to IP addresses. You can subscribe or unsubscribe users to notifications for specific services, retrieve subscription and service information, and get CIDR block information with which to update your firewall rules.

```shell
> akamai frn list cidr
# Firewall Rules Notification CIDR Blocks you are subscribed to:
# ID    Service Name (ID)                               CIDR      Port     Active       Last Action
303     Secure Edge Staging Network (8)                 XXXXXX    80,443   2007-10-13   update
306     Secure Edge Staging Network (8)                 XXXXXX    80,443   2007-10-13   update
1241    Edge Staging Network (7)                        XXXXXX    80,443   2008-11-25   update

```

You can filter results by Akamai API supported flags:
* --last-action:    Return only CIDR blocks with a change status of add, update, or delete.
* --effective-date: The ISO 8601 date(YYYY-MM-DD) the CIDR block starts serving traffic to your origin

Also you can filter services in output by `name` with `--services` parameter by provided comma separated string with names

```shell
akamai frn list cidr --services "SiteShield + Secure Edge Staging Network,Edge Staging Network"
# Firewall Rules Notification CIDR Blocks you are subscribed to:
# Showing CIDR Blocks only for: SiteShield + Secure Edge Staging Network
# ID    Service Name (ID)                               CIDR               Port     Active       Last Action
13231   SiteShield + Secure Edge Staging Network (32)   XXXXXXXX           80,443   2016-11-10   add
14540   Edge Staging Network (7)                        XXXXXXXX           80,443   2017-11-13   add
...
```

Some times you may need to get only CIDRs as output to process then with xargs or in any other way. You can do that with `--only-addresses` flag

```shell
> akamai-cli-frn list cidr --services "Secure Edge Staging Network,SiteShield + Secure Edge Staging Network" --only-addresses
1.2.3.4/32
5.6.7.8/32
```

### Update commands
You can subscribe to any service you want and unsubscribe too with `update` command

There are 2 flags:
* `--add`    comma(',') separated list of Service IDs to which you want to subscribe
* `--delete` comma(',') separated list of Service IDs to which you want to unsubscribe

Please take a note that the list of required services created in the following way:
1. We get your `current` subscriptions from Akamai
1. We append `add` list to `current`
1. We sort and uniq the `result` list
1. We remove all elements present in `delete` list from `result` list
1. We send to Akamai the `result` list

```shell
If user had subscriptions for services with ID 6 and 7, then after running the following command he will be subscribed too same list
> akamai frn --add "3,6"--delete "3" user@e-mail.com
```
